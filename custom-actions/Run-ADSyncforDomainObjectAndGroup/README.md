## Run AD Sync for Domain, Object and Group

Allows you to run AD Sync for a specific domain from the PDC to a list of DCs you supply.
The action will execute the `Sync-ADObject` cmdlet for each DC in the list. 

There is also a `Group` parameter that allows you put in a string to match so only those groups will be synchronized.

# Pre-Session behavior
The groups existing group membership is searched for the group names. Any DNS that 
match the Group name will be added to the objects.

The match is a case-insensitive match to the DN of the group. So a value of `Admin` will match `Domain Admins` and `Administrators`

The value used is also passed to the `Get-ADGroup` cmdlet `-Identity` parameter. 

# Post-Session
The value used is passed to the `Get-ADGroup` cmdlet `-Identity` parameter. This is a change in behavior from previous 
versions that would match a substring for the groups the user was a member of.

Before running sync the list of DNs will be filtered to be unique.

This will run on the ActionService directly and not use WinRM to connect 
to any servers. The action uses the service account associated with the domain to run the sync.

# Errors

If you see the error:
`Sync-ADObject : Insufficient access rights to perform the operation`

To grant permission, youâ€™ll need to launch the `ADSIEdit` tool and grant 
permission at the root of the domain for `Replication Synchronization`

# Warnings

"Unable to find a match for Group X" 

This warning is reported if the user is not a member of the group OR 
the group can't be found using `Get-ADGroup`
